Customizing Benchmarks
===============================

|F| is designed to be highly customizable, allowing you to tailor the benchmark environment to your specific needs. You can modify the configuration files to:

  - Add or remove data center locations.
  - Adjust the workload characteristics, such as the proportion of shiftable tasks.
  - Change the parameters of the RL algorithms, such as learning rates and discount factors.
  - Include additional control strategies, such as energy storage or renewable energy integration.

Check the :ref:`usage_ref` section for more information on customizing the |F| environment and running advanced benchmarks.

We are continually expanding |F| to integrate additional control strategies and external energy sources, including auxiliary battery integration and on-site renewable energy generators (solar, wind, etc.). This ongoing development ensures that |F| remains a comprehensive and up-to-date benchmarking tool for sustainable data center management.
